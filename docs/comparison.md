# Comparison & Background

## When to use this package

Use it for:

- automatic locale detection (browser, session, cookie, custom)
- automatic redirects to localized routes
- hidden default locale in URLs (`/about` instead of `/en/about`)
- fully translatable routes (`/en/humans` vs `/de/menschen`)

You don't need it if you're fine with `example.com/de/blog` /
`example.com/en/blog` only and don't need detection or unprefixed
defaults.

## Comparison to other packages

### [`mcamara/laravel-localization`](https://github.com/mcamara/laravel-localization)

The original package this one succeeds. Still maintained by
[@jordyvanderhaegen](https://github.com/jordyvanderhaegen) for
Laravel/PHP compatibility, security, and small bug fixes. Long legacy
codebase whose original architecture comes with limitations that
motivated this rewrite - see
[Why migrate](/migrating-from-laravel-localization#why-migrate).

### [`codezero-be/laravel-localized-routes`](https://github.com/codezero-be/laravel-localized-routes) (deprecated)

Route-per-locale (Nx routes per definition). No longer maintained, but
its design ideas influenced this one - here only two routes per
definition.

### [`spatie/laravel-translatable`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-translatable)

Translates **Eloquent model fields**, not routes. Works alongside this
package for translatable slugs.

## Background

I (Adam Nielsen) was a collaborator on the original
[mcamara/laravel-localization](https://github.com/mcamara/laravel-localization).
Since @mcamara has moved on from Laravel,
[@jordyvanderhaegen](https://github.com/jordyvanderhaegen) continues
to maintain it for compatibility and small fixes. This rewrite
addresses long-standing limitations that follow from the original's
runtime route generation.

The original generated **dynamic routes** (cache + compatibility
issues).
[laravel-localized-routes](https://github.com/codezero-be/laravel-localized-routes)
solved this with **static per-locale routes** (Nx per definition).
This package takes the **middle path**: each route registered
**twice** (one with `{locale}`, one without).

## Credits

- [@mcamara](https://github.com/mcamara): original creator of
  [laravel-localization](https://github.com/mcamara/laravel-localization).
- [@codezero-be](https://github.com/codezero-be): developed a static
  route-per-locale approach (e.g. `en.index`, `de.index`, `es.index`).
  While this package follows a different routing strategy (two routes
  per definition: one with `{locale}` and one without), many classes
  and much of the implementation style are adapted from
  [laravel-localized-routes](https://github.com/codezero-be/laravel-localized-routes).
- [@jordyvanderhaegen](https://github.com/jordyvanderhaegen):
  co-maintainer of
  [laravel-localization](https://github.com/mcamara/laravel-localization);
  his issue
  [mcamara/laravel-localization#921](https://github.com/mcamara/laravel-localization/issues/921)
  was the motivation for writing this package.

Since [@codezero-be](https://github.com/codezero-be) is no longer with
us, I want to acknowledge his great work and influence on this package.
Many of his ideas live on here, and I hope this helps to keep his
contributions useful to the Laravel community for years to come.
